# Tools

Looking to work more comfortably, we recommend the use of the following tools:

## 1. NODE VERSION MANAGEMENT

Using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) makes it easier to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single local environment. Even if you only need a single version of Node.js right now, we still recommend using nvm because it allows you to switch between different versions of Node (depending on the requirements of your project) with minimal hassle.

Recommendations using NVM:

- set a default Node.js version (preferably LTS version if you don't have a specific version in mind). This version will be use as fallback when there is no version to use available in the directory:

```bash
nvm install --lts /* installs LTS version of Node.js available */
nvm alias default 'lts/*' /* sets the LTS version as your default Node.js version */
```

- trigger NVM on directory change: this will avoid typing `nvm use` every time someone changes to a different folder (for instance, jumping from a project to another). To achieve this, please follow [the official guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).

## 2. VISUAL CODE EXTENSIONS

Per agreement, the frontend team uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as code editor. You are free to use a different one as long as you have working the **mandatory extensions** listed below and the workflow does not compromise the quality of the code/project.

You **must** install the mandatory extensions listed below. Recommended ones improve the experience but you are free to install or ignore them.

## Mandatory

**ESLINT** integrates ESLint into VS Code. The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version.
