    Title: '<h1>Global change in extent of mangroves for select years from 1996 to 2020.</h1>',
    Overview: '<p>This data set shows the the change in areal extent of mangrove habitat in a specific location between different time-periods. The locations are defined geometries such as countries, protected areas or custom areas-of-interest. The difference in habitat extent was calculated between 2 consecutive time-periods (t1 and t2); gain and loss are defined as the increase and decrease in extent (km<sup>2</sup>) between t1 and t2, respectively. Net change (km<sup>2</sup>) for the period t1-t2 is the sum of gain and loss. Data on the areal extent of mangrove habitat was generated by Aberystwyth University and soloEO within the framework of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) project, which is a part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Kyoto & Carbon Initiative and the Mangrove Capital Africa Programme coordinated by Wetlands International and financed by DOB Ecology. The map (v2.0) depicts the global extent of mangrove forests for the year 2010, derived by Random Forest Classification of a combination of L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5 and Landsat-7) satellite data. All satellite data and software used to derive the GMW mangrove maps are available in the public domain. Approximately 15,000 Landsat scenes and 1,500 ALOS PALSAR (1 x 1 degree) mosaic tiles were used to create optical and radar image composites covering the coastlines along the tropical and sub-tropical coastlines in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The classification was confined using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems can be expected to exist. The mangrove habitat definition was based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation and distance from ocean water. Training for the habitat mask and classification of the 2010 mangrove mask was based on randomly sampling 38 million points using the mangrove masks (for the year 2000) of Giri et al. (2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017).

    Overview: '<p>This data set shows a heatmap representing points were there is high confidence of a change in mangrove forest cover. Note this is an experimental layer, presently only available for Africa, under going validation, and will be updated in the future. Changes in mangrove coverage were identified using a combination of USGS Landsat 8 (LS8), ESA Sentinel-1 (S1) and ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) data. For the optical S2 and LS8 sensors, only scenes where cloud cover is less than 20 % were used. In general scenes were avalaible about every 14-16 days. However, for the optical sensors, cloud cover can substantially reduce data availability in some regions. Potential change features were identified within pixels masked by the 2016 GMW mangrove extent layer; where NDVI values were < 0.2, and backscatering values were < -18 dB for the VV and < -23 dB for the VH polarisation channels, respectively. To combine the scene based potential change features and to filter false positives a scoring system was used where pixels were scored based on the number of times they have been identified as a change. Where S1 identifies a change 1 is added to the score, if LS8 or S2 identify a change then 2 is added to the score. Changes identified within the LS8 and S2 sensors were considered to be more reliable and less frequent (due to cloud cover). If no change was identified for a pixel, which was previously identified as a change, and has a score > 0, then 1 was removed from the score. If the score has a value of 5 or greater then the pixel was deemed to be a ‘True’ change.  The score cannot go below 0 or above 5. Processing was undertaken on a 20 m pixel grid, and then resampled to 60 m for presentation.</p>',

NBS are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits. In this context, mitigation measures aim to avoid and reduce emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere to prevent further warming. In the context of coastal and marine NBS, mitigation measures can include reducing loss of natural habitats that store carbon (e.g., mangroves and seagrasses), or restoring natural habitats that capture carbon. Adaptation measures aim to alter behavior, systems, and ways of life to protect people, economies and the environment from climate change impact. In the context of coastal and marine NBS, these can include improve resilience of coastal ecosystems. Coastal and marine NBS provide important opportunities for responding to climate change and achieving national climate policy goals.

Calculations of remaining mangroves (i.e. mangroves that are not within protected areas and not considered investible) are based on GMW extent v 3.14.</p><p>The prices here are intended to be indicative to provide an understanding of the investability of a mangrove area. It is not intended to limit the price per ton of mangrove carbon, particularly as market prices rise for premium carbon units and high-quality blue carbon credits. These data can be used to better understand, at a national scale, the potential of blue carbon finance that can be used towards climate mitigation goals, including nationally determined contributions specified under the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>'
