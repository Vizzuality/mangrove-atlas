# Mangrove Coastal Protection

## Overview: 

Mangroves play a vital role in protecting coastlines from damage due to waves and tropical storms, easing risks of erosion and flooding to coastal communities. The data displayed in this widget quantifies, on a global scale, the socioeconomic benefits provided by mangroves in preventing damage from storms. This information can be used to incentivise conservation initiatives that protect and restore the mangrove areas most critical for coastal protection. Data are aggregated to the country-scale and benefits are expressed using three metrics: the number of people, total land area, and property values protected from flooding for three different scenarios of storm intensity (annual, 25-year, and 100-year).
These values are calculated by comparing a scenario in which all mangroves have been lost, to a scenario in which mangroves are present. The model employs spatially-explicit hydrodynamic models with socioeconomic data depicting the distribution of people and property, and considers climatic factors in both cyclonic and non-cyclonic conditions. Note that this model uses the Giri mangrove extent (2011) dataset and not GMW mangrove extents.
