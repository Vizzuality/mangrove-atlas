# Mangrove International Status
## Overview
<span>Nationally determined contributions (NDCs)</span> reflect a country’s proposed actions under the Paris Climate Agreement to cut emissions and adapt to climate change. Data used in this tool to describe a country’s NDC comes from Global Climate Watch (WRI 2022), or directly from the text of the country’s NDC.
Information on whether a country’s NDC includes coastal and marine NBS (Nature-Based Solutions) comes from a policy brief <a href="https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/coastal-and-marine-ecosystem-2806.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Lecerf et al. 2021)</a> developed in anticipation of the UNFCCC COP26 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Convention of the Parties, held in Glasgow in November 2021). NBS are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits. In this context, mitigation measures aim to avoid and reduce emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere to prevent further warming. In the context of coastal and marine NBS, mitigation measures can include reducing loss of natural habitats that store carbon (e.g., mangroves and seagrasses), or restoring natural habitats that capture carbon. Adaptation measures aim to alter behavior, systems, and ways of life to protect people, economies and the environment from climate change impact. In the context of coastal and marine NBS, these can include improve resilience of coastal ecosystems. Coastal and marine NBS provide important opportunities for responding to climate change and achieving national climate policy goals. The data presented here offer a chance to better understand where countries are already using coastal and marine NBS, and where there might be opportunities to enhance the use of NBS in future NDC revisions.
The <a href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/wetlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands Supplement</a> is a methodology report adopted by the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change), which contains guidelines for countries on improving their inventorying and reporting of GHGs from wetlands (see Coastal Wetlands Chapter 4), with the goal of providing a pathway for countries to reduce agricultural emissions from peatlands and mangroves.
<a href="https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/forest-reference-emission-levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FRELs (Forest Reference Emission Level)</a> is a benchmark for emissions exclusively from deforestation and forest degradation. Setting a FREL is a necessary first step for countries to benefit from REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Mangroves, in some cases, are part of a FREL if included in the National Forest Definition. Each country is responsible for this definition based on national context. If mangroves are considered forests in the country, , they are eligible for inclusion in all REDD+ activities, including but not limited to financing from market mechanisms or results-based payments.
