# Global change in extent of mangroves for select years from 1996 to 2020.

## Overview: 

This data set shows the the change in areal extent of mangrove habitat in a specific location between different time-periods. The locations are defined geometries such as countries, protected areas or custom areas-of-interest. The difference in habitat extent was calculated between 2 consecutive time-periods (t1 and t2); gain and loss are defined as the increase and decrease in extent (km<sup>2</sup>) between t1 and t2, respectively. Net change (km<sup>2</sup>) for the period t1-t2 is the sum of gain and loss. Data on the areal extent of mangrove habitat was generated by Aberystwyth University and soloEO within the framework of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) project, which is a part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Kyoto & Carbon Initiative and the Mangrove Capital Africa Programme coordinated by Wetlands International and financed by DOB Ecology. The map (v2.0) depicts the global extent of mangrove forests for the year 2010, derived by Random Forest Classification of a combination of L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5 and Landsat-7) satellite data. All satellite data and software used to derive the GMW mangrove maps are available in the public domain. Approximately 15,000 Landsat scenes and 1,500 ALOS PALSAR (1 x 1 degree) mosaic tiles were used to create optical and radar image composites covering the coastlines along the tropical and sub-tropical coastlines in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The classification was confined using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems can be expected to exist. The mangrove habitat definition was based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation and distance from ocean water. Training for the habitat mask and classification of the 2010 mangrove mask was based on randomly sampling 38 million points using the mangrove masks (for the year 2000) of Giri et al. (2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017).
