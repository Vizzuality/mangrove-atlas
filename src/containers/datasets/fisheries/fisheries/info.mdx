# Mangrove Fisheries

## Overview:

Mangrove forests support millions of coastal fishers. This widget maps how this mangrove fishing is spread around the world’s coastlines. World-wide, 38% of all small-scale fishers in over 100 countries fish in the mangroves and their adjacent waters. Fishing provides critical food security for many millions who depend on mangroves for food or employment , including some of the world’s most vulnerable communities.


An international group of mangrove experts, representing fisheries knowledge from 11 nations, have worked together to develop a global model of fishing intensity in mangroves. The model identified factors relevant in determining the fishing intensity in mangrove areas through a Delphi process; an iterative process by which expert opinion is solicited anonymously and consensus (in this case on the drivers of fishing intensity in mangroves) is reached. The team identified globally relevant geospatial datasets for as many factors as possible, and developed a conceptual model which included: the number of small scale fishers nationally, population density, mangrove, coral reef and shallow shelf extent, distance between the population and the mangrove, accessibility to markets and storminess. The model was then mapped to the  global scale to provide estimates of mangrove fisher number and the intensity of fishing in mangroves in 109 countries and territories globally. This analysis estimates that there are 4.1 million small scale fishers across 109 countries and territories participating in in in-mangrove, near-shore subsistence and artisanal and near-shore commercial fisheries.


Mapping employed the GMW 2016 extent and units are displayed as fisher days per km2 of mangrove per year
Maps and data quantifying the production of commercially important fish and invertebrates that are known to strongly utilise mangrove ecosystems are currently under development and will be added to this widget at a later date.
