# Ranking of change in extent of mangroves for select years from 1996 to 2020.

## Overview:

This data set shows a ranking of locations with the largest change in areal extent of mangrove habitat between different times. Where location is a defined geometry, such as a country, protected area or area-of-interest. The difference in mangrove habitat extent was calculated between 2 consecutive time periods (t1 and t2); gain and loss are defined as the increase and decrease in extent between t1 and t2, respectively. Net change for the period t1-t2 is the sum of gain and loss. Locations are then ranked by their total gain or loss (km<sup>2</sup>) within the specified time-period. Data on the areal extent of mangrove habitat was generated by Aberystwyth University and soloEO within the framework of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) project, which is a part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Kyoto & Carbon Initiative and the Mangrove Capital Africa Programme coordinated by Wetlands International and financed by DOB Ecology. The map (v2.0) depicts the global extent of mangrove forests for the year 2010, derived by Random Forest Classification of a combination of L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5, -7) satellite data with some regions updated using Sentinel-2 to create the GMW v2.5 baseline (Bunting et al., 2022). All satellite data and software used to derive the GMW mangrove maps are available in the public domain. The classification was confined using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems can be expected to exist [(10.5281/zenodo.7478491)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478491). The mangrove habitat definition was based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation and distance from oceans.
