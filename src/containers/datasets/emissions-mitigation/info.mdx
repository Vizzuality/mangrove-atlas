# Mangrove Emissions Mitigation

## Overview: 

Estimates of emissions mitigation potential for mangrove interventions (e.g., protection or restoration) compared to other selected mitigation interventions. For these interventions, the total carbon mitigation opportunity is adjusted by the estimated area of the mitigation opportunity. The mitigation potential values used supplementary data from Roe et al. (2021), which aggregated mitigation potentials from a variety of individual and sectoral studies and datasets. For the purposes of this tool, we chose to include land-based mitigation measures that focused on forests and other ecosystems (e.g., grasslands, peatlands), and did not include values related to agriculture, bioenergy, or demand-side measures (e.g., food waste). Where multiple values for a single mitigation measure were reported (e.g., Reduce Deforestation), this tool used the average value reported in the supplementary data table. The source data contained both technical and cost-effective values. Here, only the technical values are reported. We updated the mitigation potential for mangrove restoration to newly calculated values from Worthington et al. (in prep).
