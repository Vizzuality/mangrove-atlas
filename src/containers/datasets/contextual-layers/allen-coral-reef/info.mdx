# Allen Coral Atlas

## Overview:
This layer depicts the Allen Coral Atlas’s benthic classes and geomorphic zones that account for world’s tropical shallow coral reefs at 5 m resolution. More detailed information on coral reef habitat mapping and dynamic threat monitoring can be found at <a href="www.allencoralatlas.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.allencoralatlas.org</a>.
The Allen Coral Atlas is led by Arizona State University and developed in partnership with a consortium of coral reef experts to provide actionable data and a shared understanding of coastal ecosystems to communities, practitioners, and decision makers worldwide.
More information on the methods developed for both the benthic and geomorphic maps, as well as the monitoring system and auxiliary datasets, can be found at the Atlas’s <a href="https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Science and Methods page</a>.
