# Mangrove deforestation alerts

## Overview:

This data set shows a heatmap representing points were there is high confidence of a loss of mangrove forest cover. This layer has a spatial resolution of 20 m and is updated on a monthly basis. The analysis is undertaken using Sentinel-2 imagery and updated on a monthly basis. The mangrove loss alert system is based on optimised normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds used to identify mangrove losses and a temporal scoring system to filter false positives. The mangrove loss alert system was found to have an estimated overall accuracy of 92.1%, with the alert commission and omission estimated to be 10.4% and 20.6%, respectively.
