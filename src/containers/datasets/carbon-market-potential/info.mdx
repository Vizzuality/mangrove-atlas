# Mangrove Investible Blue Carbon
    
## Overview:

Estimates of mangrove forest area that can qualify for blue carbon financing that is financially sustainable over 30 years, based on prices of $5/ton and $10/ton based on <a href="https://ap5.fas.nus.edu.sg/fass/geofd/zeng%20et%20al%202021%20return%20on%20investment%20mangrove%20blue%20carbon.pdf" target="_blank">Zeng et al. (2021)</a>. These investible carbon areas are mangrove forests that can be protected through carbon financing. Areas of investible mangrove are defined as those under imminent threat of loss or decline if left unprotected by a conservation intervention. The estimate also accounts for carbon from above and below ground biomass, as well as soil carbon. Profitability of projects was based on average costs of project establishment and annual maintenance, weighted by the countryâ€™s GDP. Investible areas are rounded to the nearest 1,000
Estimates of mangroves in protected areas are based on the World Database of Protected Areas (July 2022). Calculations of remaining mangroves (i.e. mangroves that are not within protected areas and not considered investible) are based on GMW extent v 3.14.
These data can be used to better understand, at a national scale, the potential of blue carbon finance that can be used towards climate mitigation goals, including nationally determined contributions specified under the Paris Climate Agreement.
