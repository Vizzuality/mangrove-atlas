# Mangrove IUCN Ecoregion assesment

## Overview: 

Mangrove ecosystems have been impacted by a multitude of threats that have reduced their functioning and long-term viability. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is a framework for assessing the health of an ecosystem and for providing a measure of the relative risk of ecosystem collapse. The RLE can be applied to terrestrial, freshwater or marine ecosystems and works at local, national or global scales. The RLE classifies an ecosystem into one of eight categories, with the first six ordered in decreasing risk from ‘Collapsed’ to ‘Least Concern’. The remaining two being used for ecosystems lacking information (‘Data Deficient’) or yet to be assessed (‘Not Evaluated’). The assessment of an ecosystem’s risk of collapse is based on five rule based criteria. The first two, Criterion A: Reduction in geographic distribution and Criterion B: Restricted geographic distribution assess the distribution and change of the ecosystem itself, while Criterion C: Environmental degradation and Criterion D: Disruption of biotic processes and interactions, examines disturbance of key processes impacting the ecosystem. The final criterion, Criterion E: Quantitative risk analysis is based on a quantitative model of ecosystem functions. There are a number of sub-criteria capturing the time period or extent against which each Criterion is being assessed. The ecosystems overall classification is the the highest category of risk obtained through any criterion.             
For mangroves there have been a number RLE assessment completed. For this initiative RLE assessments were made at the Marine Ecoregion of the World ‘Province’ level. To date, five provinces in South East Asia have been been assessed. The assessment starts with a detail overview of the components of the mangrove ecosystem within each province including the characteristic native biota, the geographic distribution and ecosystem threats. Using geospatial data sources on the mangrove extent, vulnerability of sea level rise and vegetation degradation, each province is assessed against Criteria A to D.
