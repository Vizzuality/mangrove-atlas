This is the first global map of mangrove extent produced using an automated, reproducible, and globally consistent methodology, using a combination of optical and radar satellite data.\\\\n\\\\nMangroves are forested intertidal ecosystems that perform critical landscape-level functions related to the regulation of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment inputs into marine areas. They play a key role in helping to control the quality of marine coastal waters. Mangroves are of critical importance as breeding and nursery sites for birds, fish, and crustaceans. Additionally, they constitute important sinks for carbon storage. Once abundant along the world\\\\u2019s tropical and subtropical coastlines, mangroves are in global decline. Significant drivers of change include removal for aquaculture, agriculture, energy exploitation and other industrial development, with an unknown proportion of the remaining mangroves fragmented and degraded. Mangroves are also sensitive to climate change effects such as sea level rise, temperature extremes, and changes in hydrology.\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset has been generated by the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) \\\\u2013 a collaboration between Aberystwyth University (U.K.), solo Earth Observation (soloEO), Wetlands International, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). DOB Ecology supported the mapping in Africa through the Mangrove Capital Africa project.\\\\n\\\\n## Methodology\\\\n\\\\nThe mangrove maps were derived in two steps: 1) generation of a baseline map of global mangrove extent for the year 2010 and 2) detection of changes between the 2010 baseline and each of the other six years.\\\\n\\\\n### 2010 global mangrove extent baseline map\\\\n\\\\nThe 2010 baseline map was derived by the Random Forest Classification algorithm that used a combination of L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5, -7) satellite data. Approximately 15,000 Landsat scenes and 1,500 ALOS PALSAR (1 x 1 degree) mosaic tiles were used to create optical and radar image composites covering the coastlines along the tropical and sub-tropical coastlines in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.\\\\n\\\\nThe classification was confined using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems can be expected to exist. The mangrove habitat definition was generated based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation, and distance from ocean water. Training for the habitat mask and classification of the 2010 mangrove mask was based on randomly sampling 38 million points using historical mangrove maps (for the year 2000) of Giri et al. (2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017).\\\\n\\\\nClassification accuracy of the 2010 baseline dataset was assessed with approximately 53,800 randomly sampled points across 20 randomly selected regions. Overall accuracy was 95.25 %, while User\\\\u2019s and Producer\\\\u2019s accuracies for the mangrove class were estimated at 97.5% and 94.0%, respectively.\\\\n\\\\n### 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015 and 2016 maps of mangrove extent and changes\\\\n\\\\nThe maps for the other six years were derived by detection and classification of losses (defined as a decrease in radar backscatter) and gains (defined as a backscatter increase) between the 2010 ALOS PALSAR data and JERS-1 SAR (1996), ALOS PALSAR (2007, 2008 & 2009) and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015 & 2016) data. The change pixels for each year in question were then added or removed from the 2010 baseline raster mask (buffered to allow detection of mangrove gains also immediately outside of the mask) to produce the new yearly extent maps. Classification accuracies of the changes were assessed with over 45,000 points, with an overall accuracy of 75.0 %.\\\\n\\\\nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/10/1669).\\\\n\",\n",

(2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017).\\\\n\\\\nClassification accuracy of the 2010 baseline dataset was assessed with approximately 53,800 randomly sampled points across 20 randomly selected regions. Overall accuracy was 95.25 %, while User\\\\u2019s and Producer\\\\u2019s accuracies for the mangrove class were estimated at 97.5% and 94.0%, respectively.\\\\n\\\\n### 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015 and 2016 maps of mangrove extent and changes\\\\n\\\\nThe maps for the other six years were derived by detection and classification of losses (defined as a decrease in radar backscatter) and gains (defined as a backscatter increase) between the 2010 ALOS PALSAR data and JERS-1 SAR (1996), ALOS PALSAR (2007, 2008 & 2009) and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015 & 2016) data. The change pixels for each year in question were then added or removed from the 2010 baseline raster mask (buffered to allow detection of mangrove gains also immediately outside of the mask) to produce the new yearly extent maps. Classification accuracies of the changes were assessed with over 45,000 points, with an overall accuracy of 75.0 %.\\\\n\\\\nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/10/1669).\\\\n\",\n",
