The map (v2.0) depicts the global extent of mangrove forests for the year 2010, derived by Random Forest Classification of a combination of L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat-5, and Landsat-7) satellite data. All data and software used to derive the GMW mangrove maps are available in the public domain. Approximately 15,000 Landsat scenes and 1,500 ALOS PALSAR (1 x 1 degree) mosaic tiles were used to create optical and radar image composites covering the coastlines along the tropical and sub-tropical coastlines in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The classification was constrained using a mangrove habitat mask, which defined regions where mangrove ecosystems likely exist. The mangrove habitat definition was based on geographical parameters such as latitude, elevation and distance from ocean water. Training for the habitat mask and classification of the 2010 mangrove mask was based on randomly sampling 38 million points using the mangrove masks (for the year 2000) of Giri et al. (2011) and Spalding et al. (2010) and the water occurrence layer defined by Pekel et al. (2017).

    Title: '<h1>Mangrove deforestation alerts</h1>',
    Overview: '<p>This data set shows a heatmap representing points were there is high confidence of a change in mangrove forest cover. Note this is an experimental layer, presently only available for Africa, under going validation, and will be updated in the future. Changes in mangrove coverage were identified using a combination of USGS Landsat 8 (LS8), ESA Sentinel-1 (S1) and ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) data. For the optical S2 and LS8 sensors, only scenes where cloud cover is less than 20 % were used. In general scenes were avalaible about every 14-16 days. However, for the optical sensors, cloud cover can substantially reduce data availability in some regions. Potential change features were identified within pixels masked by the 2016 GMW mangrove extent layer; where NDVI values were < 0.2, and backscatering values were < -18 dB for the VV and < -23 dB for the VH polarisation channels, respectively. To combine the scene based potential change features and to filter false positives a scoring system was used where pixels were scored based on the number of times they have been identified as a change. Where S1 identifies a change 1 is added to the score, if LS8 or S2 identify a change then 2 is added to the score. Changes identified within the LS8 and S2 sensors were considered to be more reliable and less frequent (due to cloud cover). If no change was identified for a pixel, which was previously identified as a change, and has a score > 0, then 1 was removed from the score. If the score has a value of 5 or greater then the pixel was deemed to be a ‘True’ change.  The score cannot go below 0 or above 5. Processing was undertaken on a 20 m pixel grid, and then resampled to 60 m for presentation.</p>',

This was derived from a muli-parameter index taking into account many physical (storm and drought frequency, change in climate, mudflat extension), biological (mangrove biomass, changes in extent) and socio-economic factors (population density, fishing volume, ect.). Using different weighting for each time scale this index was translated into categories of conservation advice relevant at short-, medium- and long-term time scales.

    Title: '<h1>Mangrove Blue Carbon</h1>',
    Overview: '<p>This dataset shows the amount and density of carbon stored in mangrove biomass and soil. Total values represent the sum of aboveground carbon, and the soil organic carbon values, attributed to mangrove forests. Total values are expressed in Megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e), while mapped carbon density values are depicted as metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents per hectare (t CO<sub>2</sub>e / ha). Above-ground estimates of mangrove carbon were obtained from [Simard et al. 2019](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1665). The data were derived from remotely-sensed canopy height measurements and region-specific allometric models validated using in-situ measurements in field plots across three continents. This was converted to mean AGB carbon using the stoichiometric factor of 0.451 ([Simard et al. 2019](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1665)). Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimates of the top meter of mangrove soils  based on a methodology developed by Sanderman et al. (2018) were overlaid with 2016 mangrove extent maps from Bunting et al. 2018  to produce a global map of soil organic carbon at a 30 m spatial resolution. Aboveground and soil carbon values originally expressed in metric tonnes (megagrams) of carbon per hectare were converted to total carbon using the Bunting et al. (2018) mangrove extent for each country and converted to MtCO2e using a conversion factor of 3.67 (Howard et al. 2014).</p>',
